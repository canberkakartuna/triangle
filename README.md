## Triangle Drawer

### Project

We would like to make a triangle drawer tool with React.js and Typescript. The tool should be as in this video. https://youtu.be/h_ReXbDn1E0. The black circles in the video represent the mouse clicks, and they are not part of the project.

### Requirements

The tool should have a box centered on the screen with `DARK_GREY` rounded border. Box width and height should be `300px`.

The tool should show; 3 dots representing the corners of the triangle and three lines that connect the corner and makes it a triangle. Corners should be in `DARK_BLUE`, and lines should be in `LIGHT_BLUE`.

Corners of the triangle should be draggable within the box. While dragging, corners and lines should be updated in real-time.
